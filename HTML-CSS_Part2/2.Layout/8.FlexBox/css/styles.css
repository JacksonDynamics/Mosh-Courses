justify-content (along the main axis).  Could be row or column 
align-items (along the cross axis).
display: flex  will access flexbox.
flex-direction can be row or column.

justify-content: 

flex-start/flex-end  = pushes containers to start/end of row or column, depending on flex-direction.
center  = containers in the center.
space-evenly  = separated evenly.
space-between  =  first and last items are pushed to the beginning and end, and everything else is equally spaced in between.
space-around  = similar to space-evenly, but the first and last items are pushed half the distance from the edges as the space between every other items.

flex-wrap: wrap  =  extra items that can't fit on one line, get pushed onto a new line.

align-content: center  =   places all content right in the center, even when flex-wrap has been used.  

align-self: 
flex-start: pushes item (not container) to the top.
flex-end: pushes item (not container) to the bottom.

ALL THIS PROPERTIES ARE ON ITEMS....NOT CONTAINERS:
flex-basis (the initial size of a flex item).
flex-grow (the growth factor).
flex-shrink (the shrink factor).
flex


flex-basis ( will overwrite the width (if direction is set to row) or height property (if direction is set to column) )

flex-grow will fill in all the space of the container with whatever ratio we choose.  flex-grow: 0 has no effect. 1, will fill evenly, but if you put another item with a flex-grow of 2, that item will be twice the size of the other items set at 1.

flex-shrink set at 1 will shrink the items as the screen adjusts to fit in the container.  if set at 0, the item will not shrink

flex: is the combination of flex-grow and flex-shrink. Can also use flex-basis 

flex: 1, 1  = first element is grow.  Second is shrink.  Grow and shrink are not measurement values.  but flex-basis can be.

flex: 1, 1, 15rem
