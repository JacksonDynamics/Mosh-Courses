2 different types of images
----------------------------

Rastor and Vector images

Rastor is for photos
Vectors are for simple graphics, icons, logos

Rastor is from cameras or software.  JPG, PNG, GIF, ect.  Pixels.  More pixels = larger file size
pixels look blurry when scaled up because of limited pixels and data

Vector is created in software (Illustrator)
Format: SVG  Scalable Vector Graphics
Looks sharp at any size

|:--------------|:-------------|:----------|
|JPEG  |  16M   |              |           |
|GIF   |  256   |      *       |     *     |
|PNG   |  16M   |      *       |     *     |
|WebP  |  16M   |      *       |     *     |


Transparency is when you can have a transparent background.  The checkered background in Illustrator.
WebP is a new format, but currently is only supported by around 90% of browsers.

General practice is to use JPEG, but if you need transparency, use GIF or PNG
